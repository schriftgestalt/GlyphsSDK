# Glyphs File Format, Version 3
Glyphs saves its files in plaintext format. So the files can be viewed and edited with any text editor. Open an existing `.glyphs` file to see how it works.

- The format is based on Apples old style property list (plist) format.
- It doesn’t use the more common XML-based flavor (that is supported for reading) to save space.
- There are some small deviations from the default format. More about that in Notes.

## File Structure
Glyphs can save in two different file formats. The data structure is very similar. 
### Single file .glyphs files
This is what glyphs was always using. One file containing all the data as described below.
### Multi files package .glyphspackage
To make reading/writing big files easier and help with version control, there is now a package format. It contains the same information divided in several file. This uses a bundle (folder structure) that contains files and folders. (on MacOS, right click and choose "Show Package content")
The bundle contains this:
- A folder `glyphs` that contains one `.glyph` file per glyph. It contains the same structure than the `glyphs` elements in the single file.
- a file `fontinfo.plist` that contains the rest of the font data (kerning, masters, instances …)
- a file `UIState.plist` that contains some user state. It is in an extra file that you can ignore it in version control if you don’t like the noise.
- a file `order.plist` that contains a properties list array with glyph names to store the order of the glyphs in the font.

## Notes
- It is written without indentation. That is to save file size.
- Each key is on its own line.
- Lists have each element on one line, empty `lists` or `dicts` need to span two lines.
- Some lists (enclosed in normal parenthesis) are put on one line (e.g., `(100,200)`). This is to make it easier to read and save space. We call it *tuple* for now.
    * this is used for colors, points and nodes
- empty elements are always omitted.
    * except: in `userData` entires. There the structure is preserved.
- Numbers are always written without quotes (negative and float). Strings that look like numbers are written with quotes (mostly important in userData).
- Unicodes are written as int numbers.
- The last element in a list doesn’t get a trailing comma.
- Newlines and tabs in strings (e.g. in feature code or classes) are not escaped.
- Several values have global settings in the font object and values in each master (e.g. metrics > metricValues, axes > axesValues, stems > stemValues, numbers > numberValues). The order and count have to match.

## Element Tree
The property list file contains a dictionary with the following structure.

## Differences between version 2

Glyphs format 3 files will have the following differences from equivalent format 2 files. First, the *representational* changes:

* Within strings, certain characters (notably newlines) are now embedded directly, rather than escaped with octal backslash escaping. Strings are not *always* surrounded in double quotes e.g.: `imagePath = Screenshot.png;`

* Point values (such as anchor position) are now expressed as tuples.


Then the *structural* changes:

* The toplevel dictionary will have an additional entry called `.formatVersion`, with a value of 3. You can use the presence and value of this entry to test whether you are dealing with a format 2 or format 3 file.

* There is a new `axes` entry at top-level, which serializes a list of `GSAxis` structures.

* The `copyright`, `designer`, `designerURL`, `manufacturer`, `manufacturerURL` top-level entries have been moved into new top-level `properties` dictionary and made localizable.

* There is a new top-level `note` entry.

* `customparameter` entries have an additional `disabled` property.

* `features` entries have an additional localizable `labels` property for stylistic set names.

* Within the `fontMasters` structure:
    * Both the `alignmentZones` and `ascender`, `capheight` etc. metric values have been replaced by the `metricValues` list of dictionaries. What used to be `alignmentZones` is now a set of `over` (overshoot) properties attached to metrics. This `metricsValues` list is indexed in parallel with the toplevel `metrics` list.
    * `guideLines` has been renamed `guides`. Its `pos` value is now a tuple.
    * Axis position related properties (e.g. `weightValue`, `widthValue`, `customValue`) have been replaced by the `axesValues` list which is indexed in parallel with the toplevel `axes` list.
    * `horizontalStems` and `verticalStems` are replaced by `stemValues`, which is indexed in parallel with the toplevel `stems` list.
    * A new `numberValues` list is added, which is indexed in parallel with the toplevel `numbers` list.

* Within the `glyphs` structure:
    - The `color` entry may now take two to five numbers as a tuple, rather than just four.
    - `leftKerningGroup` and `rightKerningGroup` are renamed `kernLeft` and `kernRight`, and there are additionally `kernTop` and `kernBottom` entries for vertical kerning.
    - `leftMetricsKey` and `rightMetricsKey` are renamed `metricLeft` and `metricRight`, and there are additionally `metricTop` and `metricBottom` entries for vertical metrics keys, as well as `metricWidth` and `metricVertWidth`.
    - The `unicode` entry may now take a tuple of codepoints.
    - `case`, `direction`, `export`, `locked`, `note`, `partSettings` and `tags` entries have been added.

* Within the `layers` structure for each glyph:
    - `guideLines` has been renamed to `guides`.
    - `leftMetricsKey`, `rightMetricsKey` and `widthMetricsKey` are renamed `metricLeft`, `metricRight` and `metricWidth` , and there are additionally `metricTop` and `metricBottom` entries for vertical metrics keys, as well as and `metricVertWidth`.
    - Layers may also have a `color` entry similar to the one in the `glyphs` structure.
    - The `components` and `paths` entries are now combined into the single list of `shapes`.
    - `partSelection`, `vertOrigin` and `attr` entries have been added.

* Within the `components` structure of a shape (v3) or layer (v2):
    - The `transform` entry has been replaced by `angle`, `pos` and `scale` entries.
    - `name` has been renamed to `ref`.
    - The deprecated `disabledAlignment` entry has been replaced by a `alignment` (int) entry.
    - `anchorTo`, `attr`, `locked`, `orientation`, `piece` and `userData` entries have been added.

* The format of the `nodes` entry in the `paths` structure has changed and an `attr` entry has been added.

* There is a new `metrics` entry at top-level, which contains a list of vertical metric definitions.

* There is a new `numbers` entry at top-level, which contains a list of dictionaries representing named interpolation numbers.

* `kerning` and `vertKerning` have been renamed to `kerningLTR` and `kerningVertical`, and there is a new top-level `kerningRTL` dictionary.

* There is a new `stems` entry at top-level, which contain a list of named stem definitions.

* Toplevel `disablesAutomaticAlignment`, `disablesNiceNames`, `gridLength`, `gridSubDivision`, `keyboardIncrement`, `keyboardIncrementBig` and `keyboardIncrementHuge` entries have moved into the `settings` dictionary.
